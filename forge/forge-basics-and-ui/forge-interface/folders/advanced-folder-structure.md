# Advanced Folder Structure

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/cover-tsg-placeholder.jpg" alt="Cover image"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The folder structure doesn't have to be overly complicated to work efficiently. Below are some examples of advanced folder structures that experienced forgers have come up with, and are tuned to work for all object groups in a Forge map. An advanced folder structure is useful for categorizing every object type efficiently and semantically. Takes a bit longer to set up and takes up more budget, but is much more useful on larger projects or feature-rich maps.

## Advantages

The advantages to having an advanced folder structure are:

* All object types have a descriptive folder allocated for them
* Selecting or hiding specific groups of objects is easy and streamlined
* You are more willing to folderize objects correctly, when a good folder structure is set up

## Disadvantages

The disadvantages to having an advanced folder structure are:

* More budget usage as every folder takes up Forge Simulation memory. This only becomes an issue on maps with the Forge Simulation memory almost at 100% when attempting to re-do the folder structure
* Some forgers may find it too intimidating to use

## Examples
