# Chain Link Fences

While chain link fences can block movement and grenades, they do not obstruct bullets.

When attempting to select a chain link fence in monitor mode, it's important to note that you can only select the edges of the object. Attempting to select the object by the mesh will not work, and you may accidentally select other objects that are beyond the fence.

Additionally, it's worth noting that grappling hooks can pass through chain link fences, though the player will not be able to be pulled through them.
